# Fake Hacker News
A mock up site of the Y Combinator Hacker News

You can visit my project on Heroku: https://fake-hacker-news.herokuapp.com/  
It may not load very fast because I am using a shared cluster, not a dedicated one.

In this application, I tried to replicate the most basic features of the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website. Some of them are:
1. Create a new story.
2. List all the stories on the front page.
3. Edit the uploaded story.
4. Remove a story if needed.

Some key technologies I used in this project:
1. **NodeJS** to use server-side JavaScript and many of its useful packages, such as `method-override` and `serve-favicon`.
2. Web framework **Express** to make a web server and routings.
3. **EJS** to make dynamic HTML pages.

Some possible improvements:
